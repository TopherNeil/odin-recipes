            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Just about every Filipino loves adobo, from the call center agent with his packed Tupperware to the socialite 
                lunching at the latest fusion place in Serendra. There are as many versions of adobo as there are households, 
                but all of them share the same basic components.In English, adobo means “vinegar-braised.” Evenly-cut chunks of meat
                are first seared in hot fat or oil until they brown. Braising liquids, such as vinegar and soy sauce, are then added, 
                and the mixture is left to simmer over low heat. The moist heat gently penetrates the meat to break down the collagen 
                and tough fibers, resulting in a fork-tender texture with a thick, flavorful sauce. It’s a cooking method that’s time-consuming 
                but undeniably rewarding.
