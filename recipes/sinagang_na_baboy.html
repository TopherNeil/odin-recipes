            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The origins of Sinigang are a bit hazy, but it's believed to have originated in the Philippines during the pre-colonial era.
                The indigenous people of the Philippines have been using tamarind as a souring agent for their dishes for centuries. 
                It's likely that the dish evolved over time, with different regions and ethnic groups putting their own spin on it. 
                Sinigang became more popular in the 20th century, as it was brought to Manila and other cities by migrants from the provinces. 
                It's now considered a national dish of the Philippines and can be found in Filipino restaurants all over the world.
